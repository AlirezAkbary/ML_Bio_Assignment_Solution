## Project: Drug-Protein Affinity Classification
The project is about the prediction of binding between proteins and drugs. In phase 1, this is done by machine learning algorithms (XGBoost).


In phase 2,  the problem was to improve the limitations of the well-known model DeepDTA. By reading the state-of-the-art paper GraphDTA, which takes advantage of Graph Neural Networks, I modified DeepDTA by implementing LSTM to learn protein sequence (as DeepDTA doesn't take the sequential nature of target amino-acid structures into account) and graph convolutional network to learn drug structure. Also, I applied some interpretability methods to analyze the network learned on data and got valuable insights that the learned model is overly dependent on the drugs without a reasonable focus on the proteins.
