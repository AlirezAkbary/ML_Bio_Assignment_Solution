# Drug-Protein Affinity Classification
The project is about prediction of binding between proteins and drugs. In phase 1, this is done by machine learning algorithms (XGBoost).


In phase 2,  the problem solved by state-of-the-art graph neural networks, which has shown great power in this problem, because of graph-based structure of drugs. Also, some interpretability methods applied to analyze the network learned on data.
